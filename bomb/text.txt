phase1
---(we can directly find the number of chars via the string length functions and the storing address of the correct string)
hex code:
426f7264
65722072
656c6174
696f6e73
20776974
68204361
6e616461
20686176
65206e65
76657220
6265656e
20626574
7465722e

Border relations with Canada have never been better.


phase2(we know read_six_numbers split our string into 6 parts, and in the phase_2 function, the function first check if the first number is 1, and then use a while loop to check if the current value is 2 times the previous value )
---
1 2 4 8 16 32 


phase3(from the argument number, we first decide there should be 2 number, and the first one must be larger than 1. The difficulties comes from reading the jump table(the one we learn in switch statement))

2 707	(there may be other answers out there)


phase4(just as the last one, we know we should have two numbers after the sscanf function(the comparision betwen 0x2 and %rax), and the first number should be less than 0xe. In the function 4, I am not very sure what the function is doing(it is recursion) but if I have the first number equal to %ecx, I can get out the function with a return value 0, which is exactly what I want. The second number is easy to get(the comparision).)
